# Bot Battlr

Bot Battlr is a web app that allows users to browse a collection of bots and enlist them to form their own army. The user can also release or delete bots from their army.

### How to use

Upon launching the app, you will be greeted with the homepage containing the bot collection and your army.

### Browse the bot collection

You can browse the bot collection by scrolling through the list of bots displayed on the left side of the page. You can click on each bot card to view more details about the bot, including its name, description, and attack/defense values.

### Enlist a bot

To enlist a bot in your army, simply click the "Enlist" button on the bot card. The bot will then be added to your army on the right side of the page.

### Release a bot

To release a bot from your army, simply click the "Release" button on the bot card in your army. The bot will then be removed from your army.

### Delete a bot

To delete a bot from the bot collection, click the "Delete" button on the bot card in the bot collection. This will remove the bot from both the bot collection and any armies that have enlisted it.
